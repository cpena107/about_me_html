# About me Part 1

Make a web page that contains some information about yourself and what your career goals are. What do you want to do after you graduate? What are you interested in CS-wise? Why are taking this class?

I'm also a little out of touch with everything. Please culture me. Can you recommend me some music, movies, and/or TV shows? 

## HTML Requirements
Your web page should include h1, p, img, ul, li, and a tags. As well as a table. 

## CSS Requirements
Your CSS should include tag, class, and id selectors. It should also include styling for fonts (color, size, decoration), backgrounds (color or image), and borders (to emphasize certain areas).

You will not receive credit if you use inline-css. You must use a separate stylesheet.

# About me Part 2

Make a web page that contains some information about yourself and what your career goals are. What do you want to do after you graduate? What are you interested in CS-wise? Why are taking this class?

I'm also a little out of touch with everything. Please culture me. Can you recommend me some music, movies, and/or TV shows?

## HTML Requirements

Your web page should include the same content as part 1. Using Bootstrap could inspire you to do add more to make it look even better which is ok. (such as supplementing music recommendations with album art). Use Bootstrap to make everything look good. You might need to group elements in  to apply some styles.
## CSS Requirements
You do not need additional styling on top of Bootstrap. Just the bootstrap CSS from CDN. 

Some Bootstrap resources:
* https://getbootstrap.com/
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/

<strong>For full credit, this version should look professional and utilize Bootstraps grid system (container, row, col) in at least one area.</strong>

# Testing

This assignment uses pytest and BeautifulSoup to test your HTML pages, only the HTML file is automatically tested, and the CSS portion needs to be manually checked.
To run the tests use this command ```pytest tests/*``` or replace `*` with `part1_tests.py` or `part2_tests.py`
